# RANDOM-FOREST-REGRESSION

### IMPLEMENTION OF RANDOM FOREST REGRESSION USING SCIKIT-LEARN PYTHON LIBRARY TO PREDICT THE PRICE OF THE CAR

- Random Forest Regression is a supervised learning algorithm that uses ensemble learning method for regression
- It operates by constructing several decision trees during training time and outputting the mean or majority of the classes as the prediction of all the trees
- In this project, at first the dataset is loaded and pre-processing steps are carried out
- Then, by using RANDOM FOREST REGRESSOR MODEL from scikit-learn python library, the pre-processed data are trained and tested
- Finally, the accuracy of the trained model is predicted
